    ================================================================================

                        HTTP basics: requests, responses and using cURL

Use cURL instead of file_get_contents to make an API request
Response codes: get the HTTP status code
Request headers: add meta data about the request
Response headers: read meta data about the response
Get all individual response headers in an array
Use an API that requires a specific request header
Request method: change the method to get a different result with the same URL
Request body: add a payload to send data along with the request

                        REST and RESTful APIs: using them from PHP
            
REST and RESTful APIs: what are they?
Access a RESTful API in PHP with cURL
Use the Guzzle HTTP client for object-oriented API code
Use an SDK: compare the Stripe API to its SDK

    ================================================================================

                    Create a RESTful API: build a framework for serving the API

Start writing the API: enable URL rewriting
The front controller: get the resource, ID and the request method
